In the broadest geographical sense, Tokyo metropolis, Tōkyō-to (東京 都) is frighteningly large. More than a quarter of Japan's total population resides there. The city is located in Tokyo Bay, at the mouth of the Sumida River (隅田川). It also houses 370000 foreigners. Plus the two of us ...

The City of Tokyo (東京) is an assembly of 23 municipalities. Former villages, craftsman towns, shopping districts, fishing spots have grown and merged over time, retaining their distinctive features and giving a special stamp to each Tokyo area. On various world lists, this city is leading as the most extraordinary experience, the most expensive city, the best city transportation, shopping and nightlife ... one of the best cities to live.

The tourist experiences have helped us a lot in understanding the organization here, the habits of life. But tourists and potential settlers have a completely different approach to getting to know the city. It was only when we made the decision to live here for a few years, when we arrived in temporary accommodation, that we began to consider Tokyo as a future home.

For the first month we had organized accommodation. It seemed like enough time for us to do all the paperwork for the relocation, visit as many places and apartments as possible, select and equip a new home. At the airport, we were issued residency (ID) cards based on visas, and after a few days, we checked into the municipality and checked in at our place of residence. Then we met the girls from the agency who were helping us find an apartment. 

The various parts of the city are connected by the JR Yamanote Line, a circular, very frequent train path that forms what is commonly called central Tokyo. Along with other rail and metro lines it forms the core of perfect urban transport.

When someone here asks "Where do you live?", It means "Which station is closest to you?". From a transportation perspective, it is ideal to live next to a hub or a line that drives to your daily needs. For us, this is Osaki Station, on the JR Yamanote line. Thus, the first determinant in the search for an apartment was that it was located near the southern half of the route of this line. Otherwise, the circle is about 60 minutes, over 29 stations. 

Other details about the size of the apartment, organization, my need for some greenery, water proximity, were conveyed to the agents and we received the first offers for apartments.One group of apartments was in the immediate vicinity of our temporary accommodation, the Shinagawa Station. These are artificially made terrains, the neighborhoods are surrounded by water, they are completely contemporary, tidy, a mixture of commercial and residential buildings. Shops, restaurants are mostly tied to the station and the environment, the deeper in the neighborhoods is the quiet. But also they lack any content. For anything local, vivid and authentic, it is necessary to drive to other parts.

I later read that the neighborhoods are also called Gaijin Ghettos, by their name for foreigners. These are essentially artificial settlements, designed and organized to fit the Western world and their habits. The apartments are comfortable, the buildings are packed with extras, they are tall and have an amazing view of the attractive parts of Tokyo. One such overlooking the Rainbow Bridge, completely delighted us.

However, somehow we didn't find ourselves in that circus. We did not come here to look at the lights of Tokyo from a modern apartment, but to feel this unusual city as much as possible, to meet cordial locals, to try their habits and to enrich our life experiences. Our decision was completely confirmed by local friends with comments "Well nobody actually lives there!". Also, the abundance of earthquakes that awaits us is much better tolerated on the mainland than on the ground stolen from the sea.

This choice reduced us to several stations west of Osaki. We already knew some neighborhoods that are very vivid, but off our rail road. The attractive green areas on that side did not have apartments nearby that fit our requirements. And we weren't in the mood to push the boundaries so much by staying in traditional Japanese houses, sleeping on tatami, etc. 

Ebisu offered large, comfortable apartments, tucked away in intimate streets among embassies, private homes, but with a long walk to transportation. We had visited Meguro a few days earlier in search of furniture, because this is where the Meguro dori, street of designed furniture is located. Apart from my personal professional enthusiasm, the area offered everything we expected ... Japan, local cafes, shops, a nearby park, a river. 

We ended up thinking about a few offered apartments. In those day or two of our loud thinking and consulting with agents, their neglect or cultural differences, they failed to explain the procedure of renting an apartment, applying for it and rapid changes in the market. We were unpleasantly surprised to realize that all of our options were probably already rented out. That brought us to the beginning, only with a reduced choice. Again, hours of searching the web ... 

Procedure itself involves choosing a flat, negotiating conditions, then applying. The landlord then analyzes the candidates, and after his decision, the firm closes the paperwork and we get the keys. It all takes about ten days.

While learning about the Meguro region, I was particularly interested in the Meguro River. A few kilometers long, with cherry trees on both riverbanks, one of the best places for sakura (櫻), daily walks, cycling. In one of the city use guides, Nakameguro is highlighted as a particularly interesting part. There we took a look at several apartments in a brand new building, that did not quite meet rest of the requirements. The trouble is, it's not on the JR Yamanote line. But I just decided we would live on the Meguro River! 

One afternoon we walked downstream ... hidden by the canopy, the locals sat in front of their houses, the many colorful cafes and design shops attracted walkers, passing by cyclists, moms driving toddlers ... there could be a home. When we later discovered that there was a bus that runs directly to Osaki, no less efficient than the train, we became excited. It seems we have a winning combination ...
