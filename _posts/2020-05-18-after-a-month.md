A month ago, we took off on our two-year adventure. It seems like a good time to remember the details ... 

We flew via Munich. In the first attempt, it was without success, the plane had to return after a couple of hours of flight. We were given accommodation, transportation and the next day we flew over Asia on another plane. At Haneda Airport, we went through a different procedure as immigrants, got the necessary papers and a residence (ID) card, picked up our pile of luggage and headed to Tokyo downtown.

For the first month we had been arranged a temporary accommodation, serviced apartment in [Bureau Shinagawa](https://www.space-d.co.jp/en/shinagawa). From them, we received a thorough overview of what awaits us at the airport, who to report to, transportation options, with prices and exact departures, the address we arrive at and all the details. 

Shinagawa (品 川) is located south of the Imperial Palace, on the shores of Tokyo Bay. It is partly located on artificial islands and has housed the administrative buildings of many companies. The station is important because it is used by Shinkansen.

After finding the accommodation, we had a task to complete the paperwork of the residence registration, the  bank, health insurance, telephone number, finding an apartment, furnishing... all in a month...

The registration of residence is done in the municipality to which the address of residence belongs. For Shinagawa, it is Minato-ku (港区), whose name means port. Interestingly, this was a discussion between the clerk, who speaks only Japanese and us with English. With a lot of smiles, nodding our heads, we were given an address.

The bank was recommended to us by other foreigners who have been in Japan for a long time, as one of two that has an English language service. The Japanese have completely deviated in some things, so the choice of card color was waiting for us as an important moment of opening an account ... In the current days, it will turn out that the banking system here is different from what we are used to. At least for foreigners. The online option means entering names and addresses in Japanese in the forms ... The card is only for withdrawing money at an ATM in Japan. It is practically impossible to get a credit card as a foreigner, no matter how long you have been in Japan. We need a phone number to open an account, and when we went to get the phone number and the number for me, they asked for our account number. There are other banks that do not ask for a phone number, but have a service exclusively in Japanese ...

The phone number is part of a bundle, and we decided to wait a bit to accidentally wait for the release of the iPhone 6 :) We overcame the situation of the account / number node by taking Lazar's contract in his name. He got the phone number from the company, so he easily opened an account. The agreement with the employee in the Docomo service also meant a lot of smiles, nodding his head, but also a translator who participated by phone. The clerk spoke to the translator, the translator to us, and all that in the other direction ... Their bundle usually include unlimited calls, at least 2GB of internet, but they charge for SMS, if there is any possibility at all. In the worst case, the quality of the internet is 3G. The next day I became the owner of a phone and a Japanese number! Now I can make as many phone calls as I want. I just don't know who to call?!

Health insurance is mandatory in Japan and covers most of the costs. Patients can report to both private and public clinics. The first examination or when it is urgent can be done without an appointment. After that, an appointment is usually called and arranged, and scheduled patients always have the advantage. The insurance cards were completed by the company, and in the coming days we will go to see what a visit to the doctor looks like in practice. For now, the choice of clinic limits the list of those in which English is used. I discovered several associations that provide support to foreigners regarding health care. They offer explanations, scheduling, even an interpreter.

Most of the time since we came, we have dedicated ourselves to finding an apartment, designing the decoration, providing furniture and appliances. I described the location selection in the "[Searching for a new home](https://www.nipponija.com/searching-for-a-new-home/)" topic. Back in Belgrade, we set some initial guidelines, frameworks for our search. Huge help came from the girls from the [Housing Japan](http://housingjapan.com/) agency. For each apartment that we will see, we received a document at the beginning of the tour with the details of the address, the basis of the apartment, a description of the costs. After a whole day of running, we analyzed the offer and reduced the number of papers to as small as possible for the shortlist.

It meant a whole lot that they drove us around and thus saved us time and money. Part of the offer of apartments was their proposal, but I also found a large number of others, and spent hours searching for other agencies in Tokyo. It is interesting that agencies do not have an absolute right to rent an apartment, but the choice is available to everyone. The rental process involves our application, with personal details, some specific requests, bargaining. There may be more people interested in the same property, so the landlord makes the choice. Annual costs are often increased by the monthly maintenance of the building, and initially there is also a deposit and something called key money. This amount, unlike the deposit, is not refundable, and is in the amount of one rent. It was an unpleasant surprise ... Everything about paperwork and negotiations was done by the agency. We were the only ones interested in the apartment, so bargaining ruled out key money! There was no end to our happiness when they informed us that the agency would move us and report to a new address. Later, our enthusiasm was complemented by the service of translating all the panels around the house and from the appliances. Treatment in Japan will spoil us ...

Temporary and new accommodation overlapped in just a few days, so we had to quickly make a new apartment at least for basic functions. We visited the furniture shop, equipment and device shops in advance to know what we can count on and what the costs will be. Most of it was actually an online search. Unfortunately only Ikea has an English site. For the others, I translated, devised a plan, then checked in the shop, back home for finishing, all several times. The most fun part is the final choice and purchase. Smiles, nodding, gesturing. Buying without a car involves either towing things back or using some delivery, which is usually not free. This is followed by the obligatory filling in of forms and delivery details, most often in the Japanese alphabet. Fortunately, we are not the only foreigners, so I guess they are prepared for all the craziness. So we came up with the idea to write cards with personal data, address and copy from it as needed.

We are now in a new apartment. It is near Aobadai (青葉 台), in the municipality of Meguro-ku (目 黒 区) which is mostly residential. There are a few little things left to complete. It's nice ... We have set up a home for us, for family and friends who expect us to visit. Everything basically went without much nervousness, without stress. We get used to the new environment, transportation options, get to know the area, shops, restaurants. We are planning what to do next.

Our life in Japan can begin!

As soon as we learn the language;)
