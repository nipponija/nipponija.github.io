The spirit of od times in Tokyo is felt in the area of Asukusa (浅 草). Located on the banks of the Sumida River, Sumida gawa (隅田川), it is aboundant in temples, parks, picturesque streets and traditional shops.

It is an unavoidable path for tourists, who indulge in a relaxed but colorful and cheerful atmosphere. Locals do their shopping here, visit religious sites, gather about festivals and festivities, complement the postcard of everyday life.

Kappabashi (合 羽 橋) is an attractive street equally attractive to tourists, future and permanent residents of Tokyo. It brought together vendors and artisans, offering everything needed to equip a kitchen or start a restaurant business.

We took the day off for a tour in our need to tidy up a new home. Still, it is also a great way to learn a lot about Japanese habits, how to prepare and serve food and drink, customs and the past through multicolored pottery and antique items.

Going to a restaurant in Tokyo generally involves taking a long tour of its window, which features photorealistic food models on the menu. This is especially true for anyone who does not speak Japanese, as the menus are usually not translated. The precision of craftsmanship and the resemblance to real food is simply fascinating.

It's hard to leave Tokyo without at least some souvenir from Koppabashi Street. Pendants and magnets that mimic sushi and rolls are instantly opening your appetite.
