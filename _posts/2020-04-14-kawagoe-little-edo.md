When  *Tokyo*  was founded in the 15th century, its original name was  *Edo*  (江 戸). From a small fortified place it developed into an important political center with the feudal government headquarters. 

During the  *Edo*  period from the 17th to the 19th century, *Kawagoe* (川 越) was a trading city, crucial to providing a diverse range of goods and a strategically important supplier of resources. Wealthy merchants  became so powerful, allowing them to build their  *Karazukuri*-style stores and warehouses, which meant high level of fire and theft protection. Many of these facilities still exist today, giving the city visitors a romantic stroll  through *Edo*-style setting.

We found this intriguing, so we decided to make a day trip to *[Kawagoe](http://www.koedo.or.jp/foreign/english/)* and make a a break in the stressful pursuit of an apartment in  *Tokyo* . We easily arrived by train, taking *JR Yamanote* line from *Shinagawa*  to  *Ikebukuro*  station, where we switched to the  *Tobu Tojo*  line, express train that takes 30 minutes to Kawagoe and costs 470 yen in one direction. We walked around the city, although there is a round bus line. Pedestrian street is connecting train station to various  attractions, framed on both sides by shops of various contents, craft shops, cafes... prices are noticeably lower than  *Tokyo*.

Kurazukuri no Machinami (蔵 造 り の 町 並 み), a few hundred meters long street, is one of the most interesting parts of the city. It represents a series of former warehouses and shops that have survived to this day. Japanese buildings are usually made of wood, susceptible to fire. Karazukuri style involves a much more expensive way of building. Thick walls of several layers, combining metal, clay and wood, formed a shield from fire and thieves. The best proof of success is the survival of these objects.

Today, these facilities house craft shops, restaurants, shops. We took a look at handmade pottery, tried snacks of soy, beans and other traditional foods. Every tourist attraction in Japan should be avoided on weekends. Rows along street candy stores, columns of sidewalk walkers ... we had the most trouble avoiding cars that crammed us into the confined space of pedestrian lines.

Kawagoe is also known for producing sweet potatoes, once a common daily food item, and today you can try traditional dishes, potato noodles, desserts. One such candy attracted a large number of walkers, so we joined. Very simple in appearance and taste, eaten hot or cold, and is basically a combination of sweet potatoes, red bean paste, and rice wraps. Unlike our strong, sweet cakes, this one is mild but very enjoyable.

Alley of sweets, Kashiya Yokochō, (菓子 屋 横 丁), is named after the alternating shops that produce and sell traditional Japanese sweets. Immediately after the Great Earthquake of 1923, sweets became scarce in Tokyo, prompting artisans to produce candy, ice cream, sweet dessert, bean paste, rice crackers. There were nearly 70, but today they are just over 20. As much as the crowd allowed, we enjoyed a walk on the paved street, curiously discovering what it was worth to try.

The Toki no Kane (時 の 鐘), a bell tower, a landmark near the street of the storage houses, is a symbol of the city. It was built in the 19th century on the site of an old tower that was destroyed by a large city fire. It rings several times a day.

From the main street, alleys spread on both sides, leading us to small temples, neat gardens. We easily spent the day. The time we set aside was not enough to get around all the interesting things about working hours. We are interested, so Kawagoe will surely be a frequent outing from modern and fast Tokyo, as early as October, when traditional festivals are happening.
